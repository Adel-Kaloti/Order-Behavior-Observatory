### ❗ Main Business Problem

This project analyzes three key business challenges:

1. **Are we growing in a healthy way?**  
   Quantity and sales are increasing, but it is unclear whether profit is keeping pace or being eroded by discounts and low-margin products.

2. **Which categories and sub-categories are really driving or hurting performance?**  
   Management needs to identify the top profit drivers and the underperforming segments to focus marketing, pricing and assortment decisions.

3. **How stable is demand across regions and time?**  
   Volatile trends in some product groups make inventory planning difficult and may lead to stockouts in high-growth items and overstock in declining ones.

  Looking at the full historical trend and focusing on 2023:

1. **Strong growth in 2023**
   - Total Sales in 2023 reached **$733.2K**, with a **+20.36%** increase vs. the previous year.
   - Total Profit was **$93.4K**, up **+14.24% YoY**.
   - Total Quantity sold was **12.5K units**, growing **+26.83% YoY**.

2. **Seasonality and year-end uplift**
   - Monthly trends for Sales, Profit, and Quantity show a clear build-up from the first half of the year toward **stronger performance in Q4**.
   - The dashboard highlights how seasonality affects both demand (Quantity) and profitability.

3. **Healthy but slightly pressured profitability**
   - While Sales and Quantity grew faster than Profit, the gap suggests **margin pressure**, likely due to higher discounts or a shift to lower-margin products in some months.

4. **Actionable takeaways**
   - 2023 was a growth year overall, but monitoring **profit margins** and **discount behavior** is critical to sustain healthy profitability while continuing to scale sales volume.

### 🔍 Sub-Category Insights

- Strong profit growth in **Appliances, Binders, Phones, Storage and Labels** indicates these sub-categories are key drivers of overall performance.  
- **Envelopes, Fasteners and Machines** show negative YoY change, suggesting issues in pricing, discounting or weakening demand.  
- Extreme swings in **Tables** and **Bookcases** highlight high volatility and the need for closer monitoring of stock levels and margins.  
- Focusing marketing and inventory efforts on the top-growing sub-categories while reviewing the underperformers can significantly improve total profitability.

### 2. Business Recommendations

1. **Double-down on high-performing sub-categories**  
   Invest more in **Technology and Office Supplies**, especially top growers like **Appliances, Phones, Storage and Binders** (stock availability, marketing, cross-sell bundles).

2. **Reassess low-performing and volatile segments**  
   Review **Furniture**, **Envelopes, Fasteners, Machines** and highly volatile items (e.g., **Tables, Bookcases**) for:  
   - Price and discount strategy  
   - Product assortment (keep / redesign / phase out)  
   - Supplier terms and cost structure

3. **Protect margins while keeping growth**  
   - Monitor **discount impact** on profit at category and sub-category level.  
   - Define clear discount rules for low-margin products and peak seasons.  

4. **Improve inventory & demand planning**  
   - Use historical seasonality (Q4 peaks) to plan stock levels in advance.  
   - Prioritize safety stock for **high-growth, high-margin** sub-categories and reduce overstock in declining ones.

5. **Create a recurring performance review using this dashboard**  
   - Use the Tableau dashboard monthly to track **Sales, Profit, Quantity and YoY%**.  
   - Build a simple action log: which categories to push, protect, fix, or exit based on the latest data.
